Bee that seek source

I really need to more word in my vocab bank

## Why
I'm tired of reverse image search and have to sift through 20 difference Pinterest link just to find same **7** same Pinterest's pin on multiple lang and **13** difference Wattpad stories.

So I'm automated it. 🤖

## How
with power off procrastination , [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) , [html-node-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-html-parser) and a burning passion for giving original artist credit their deserve.

I scrape search result ( Google image , Yarndex , ...etc ) , gather links to a "image source" and filter *some* that probably contain the original artist information
